    <p>1. Open <strong>https://selectext.app/login</strong> manually in a new tab and choose a google account.
        2. Once signed in, resume the video and pause it, then click the toggle again.
        3. The text should then be detected and you will stay signed in on this device.</p></div>
<div class="selectextWhyMessageWrapper">
    <p>Selectext uses a paid service to detect the text in the video (we pay this cost not you).
        We require you to sign in so we can prevent someone gaining malicious access to this service.
        That would cost us a lot of money that we can't afford as a free app.</p></div>
